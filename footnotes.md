# ONE: Original Pirate Material

1 This definition is derived from Virginia Crisp, Film Distribution in the Digital Age: Pirates and Professionals (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), 186. Alf Rehn, “Electronic Potlatch: A Study on New Technologies and Primitive Economic Behaviors” (PhD diss., Royal Institute of Technology, 2001), 57–58, refuses to use the term “pirate” to refer to Scene groups. I dispute this decision, though, and use the formulation here throughout.

9 Although, see William Davies, The Limits of Neoliberalism: Authority, Sovereignty and the Logic of Competition (Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications, 2014) for a history of this supervisory terminology with respect to markets. Wendy Brown, Undoing the Demos: Neoliberalism’s Stealth Revolution (New York: Zone Books, 2015) also provides a worthwhile critique of such cultures.

11 The economic character of the Warez Scene, on which this book expands, has already been addressed by Alf Rehn, “The Politics of Contraband: The Honor Economies of the Warez Scene,” The Journal of Socio-Economics 33, no. 3 (July 2004): 359–74. I do not radically depart from the analysis in this paper but instead broaden and deepen our understanding by more explicitly setting out the activities undertaken in this subculture.

124 The tell-tale sign of a topsite on campus is short, sporadic bursts of high-speed data transfers both incoming and outgoing from a limited subset of IP addresses. However, as bandwidth capacity has increased and P2P networks have become increasingly common, in the period between that covered by the documentation to which I have access and the contemporary Warez Scene, it is not clear whether or not such sites have become harder to detect.

15 Some servers share addresses and use translation technologies such as Network Address Translation (NAT) to route the packet to the correct machine on a local network, but for the purposes of simple explanation, the generalization that “every machine on the internet has an IP address” is fine.
16 The address that I use as an example here is in a reserved range for local networks. That is, the 192 range that I here use as an example can in reality only be used for local addresses and not on the global internet. Another example of a reserved IPv4 address is 127.0.0.1, the address that a computer can always use to refer to itself.
