<dt><b>Addline.</b><dt><dd>The command that will add a user to a topsite. This command contains the user’s Internet Protocol (IP) details, ident mask, and other security features.</dd>
<dt><b>Affiliate.</b><dt><dd>An arrangement whereby a release group is associated with a topsite and “pres” its releases on that site. It can also refer to the affiliation of courier groups with a site.</dd>
<dt><b>ASCII art.</b><dt><dd>An artistic mode in which graphics are constructed from textual characters using the American Standard Code for Information Interchange.</dd>
<dt><b>Autotrader.</b><dt><dd>A courier who uses software to transfer releases between topsites automatically without any human intervention. It is also used to refer to such software itself. It is generally frowned upon but is also a seemingly widespread practice.</dd>
<dt><b>Bittorrent.</b><dt><dd>A protocol for the distribution of content between peers. It is often but not exclusively used in the lower echelons of the piracy hierarchy.</dd>
<dt><b>Bouncer (BNC).</b><dt><dd>A proxy to which users connect. These mechanisms hide or cloak a topsite’s actual IP address. Bouncers can handle either just the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) command channel or can also take the form of “traffic bouncer” that also masks the data stream. There are also IRC bouncers that keep users connected to an Internet Relay Chat server, which means that they do not have to reconnect to the server every time and that their connecting IP address remains hidden.</dd>
<dt><b>Bulletin Board System (BBS).</b><dt><dd>A precursor to the internet that offered dial-in access to a single machine. The Scene originated in BBS cultures and moved to the internet in the 1990s. Courier. An individual who moves releases between sites to build ratio credit for download and to participate in courier charts. The act of transferring a release, in competition with other couriers, is called “racing.” Previously, in earlier BBSs, a courier was also referred to as a “broker.”</dd>
<dt><b>Courier Charts.</b><dt><dd>Competitive scoring systems that rank couriers. Based on weektop scorecards.</dd>
<dt><b>Crack.</b><dt><dd>A modification to a piece of software that removes its copyright protection routines. Often bundled with releases. Daemon. A piece of server software that runs as a background process, rather than interactively. Examples include web servers and FTP servers that serve remote users. Topsites use FTP daemons.</dd>
<dt><b>DRM.</b><dt><dd>Digital Rights Management. Programming routines that aim to make it impossible, illegally, to copy an artefact. Cracks aim to circumvent DRM/TPM.</dd>
<dt><b>Dupecheck.</b><dt><dd>A database of previous scene releases, allowing a release group to ascertain whether a release is a duplicate of a previous work.</dd>
<dt><b>Eggdrop.</b><dt><dd>A piece of software for running IRC bots. It is frequently used to run topsite bots.</dd>
<dt><b>Exif.</b><dt><dd>Exchangeable image file format. An image file format that may contain metadata exposing the original source.</dd>

<dt><b>Leet-speak.</b><dt><dd>A contraction of “elite speak”—a form of slang communication that uses text and numbers. Often, the numbers “1337” or “31337” are used to mean “leet” of “eleet” for the digits’ resemblance to “e,” “l,” and “t.”</dd>
<dt><b>MP3.</b><dt><dd>The MPEG-2 Audio Layer III codec. A music compression format.</dd>
<dt><b>NFO Files.</b><dt><dd>Short for iNFOrmation file. A text file that contains information about a release. Usually also populated with ASCII art.</dd>

<dt><b>RAID.</b><dt><dd>A Redundant Array of Independent Disks. This is a storage schema that makes additional copies of data locally, spread across many different hard-disk drives (“striping”), in order to protect against the risk of catastrophic drive failure and data loss.
